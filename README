uIP is a very small implementation of the TCP/IP stack that is written

This is based on some other guys efforts, he did the heavy lifting for uip-0.9. I've ported this to uip-1.0 and added a few enhancements like selecting the networking interface etc.

This is tested on Cygwin.

Get in x86-gcc and just `make`.

Then you should be able to run ./uip.exe if everything went well.

uip binds to the IP address which is clearly set in main.c, you can modify it to listen on other IPs. By default it listens on 192.168.1.251:80. So, if you run uip.exe and connect to port 80 of 192.168.1.251 (assuming that you are on same subnet etc) you'll start receiving "hello" strings from the uIP stack.
